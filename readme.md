# About

Pylapse creates time-lapse video from a collection of images with minimal interaction.

# Libraries

<a href=https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg>FFmpeg</a> is used to stitch the images into a video.

# Use

If you want the full package, run `pylapse.py`. If you already have a collection of processed images then run `create_video.py` to build a video. Though before you launch either you should configure <a href=https://github.com/Maddix/Pylapse/wiki/How-to-configure-config.json>config.json</a>.
